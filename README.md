ClubConnect

Student Club Management Platform

ClubConnect is a full-scale web platform designed to modernize how students discover, join, and engage with school clubs and extracurricular activities. The system focuses on participation, impact tracking, and long-term student growth, and is built to meet national and international competition standards.

Overview

Schools often struggle to keep students engaged beyond basic sign-ups. ClubConnect solves this by combining smart recommendations, gamification, analytics, and accessibility into a single, easy-to-use platform for students and club leaders.

Core Features
AI-Based Recommendations

ClubConnect uses data-driven logic to suggest clubs and events based on student interests, past activity, and engagement patterns. Students also receive personalized networking recommendations with peers who share similar goals.

Gamification System

The platform includes a structured rewards system that encourages consistent participation. Students earn points, unlock achievement badges, advance through multiple levels, and appear on leaderboards that promote healthy competition.

Analytics Dashboard

Interactive dashboards display participation trends, engagement levels, and club performance over time. These insights help officers and advisors make informed decisions and improve club outreach.

QR Code Attendance

Club officers can generate QR codes for events, allowing students to check in quickly using their devices. Attendance is recorded automatically and linked to student profiles.

Progressive Web App (PWA)

ClubConnect can be installed on mobile devices and supports push notifications and limited offline functionality, making it accessible even without constant internet access.

Social Feed and Community Tools

Students can create posts, interact through likes and comments, and stay updated on club activity in real time. This creates a central hub for school involvement.

Student Portfolio Builder

The platform automatically tracks club participation, leadership roles, and skill development. Students can export this information as a portfolio for college or scholarship applications.

Multilingual Support

ClubConnect supports five languages, including right-to-left layout for Arabic. Users can switch languages dynamically without reloading the application.

The application follows WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines, includes ARIA labels, supports keyboard navigation, and is designed to be usable by students with diverse accessibility needs.
